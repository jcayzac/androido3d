Build instructions:
===================

1) Open Terminal (or iTerm2/etc.)
2) Change to the exporter's root directory (the one this file is in!)

	$ cd /path/to/androido3d/project/sample-applications/android/binary-exporter-and-viewer

3) Create the local.properties file, and make the sdk.dir
   property point to your Android SDK.

   Note: You can skip this step if you have defined the
   ANDROID_HOME environment variable in your bash.profile,
   in this case the file will be created automatically.

	$ echo 'sdk.dir = /path/to/android-sdk-mac_x86' >local.properties

4) Run ant to build the application.
