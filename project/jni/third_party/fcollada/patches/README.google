 Description:
  This library is used to read and write COLLADA files (http://www.collada.org/).
  
 Local Modifications:
 - Added FArchiveXML from FCollada distribution - this is a necessary piece to
   compile the library. It was moved down the hierarchy to provide a hermetic
   build.
 - Changed FUtils/Platforms.h to include <base/cross/config.h> instead of defining
   int32/uint32 etc. in an incompatible way.
 - Changed FUtils/FUStringBuilder.h to remove overloaded append() that conflict
   with other definitions due to int32/uint32 types changing after inclusion of
   <base/cross/config.h>
 - Changed FUtils/FUtils.h to define FCOLLADA_NOMINMAX
 - Protect against previous definitions of NOMINMAX in FUtils/FUtils.h
 - Changed project files and solutions to build with google3. Note: only Win32
   is working currently.
 - Fixed a bug in FCDocumentTools::StandardizeUpAxisAndLength():  code was applying standardization to nodes multiple times, resulting in incorrect geometry (1248029)
 - Added #include "FCollada.h" to a number of source files
 - Added #include <map> to FCDocumentTools.cpp
 - Added #include <algorithm> to FMVector3.h
 - Commented out macintosh call to AddFolderDescriptor() in FUFileManager.cpp and added assert(0)
   since filename must be converted from c-string to pascal string
 - conditionally #include <stdint.h> in encoding.h, xmlstring.h
 - Added #include of vector and "using" declarations for STL min and max to StdAFX.h to get this building on Mac again.
 - changed vcproj settings to build PDB files of appropriate name in all builds (fcollada.pdb, farchivexml.pdb) and not to use edit-and-continue
 - changed FUURi constructor to accept POSIX-style absolute paths (paths starting with /) for MS Windows
   also changed FUUri::GetAbsolutePath() to deal with this case as wella
 - changed Sconstruct and Sconscript to reference to the local setup
 - Modified the ImportFileFromMemory function in FArchiveXML.cpp to not create
   an unused copy of the source document.
 - Fixed the cloning logic in the Clone function found in
   FCDGeometryPolygons.cpp to properly copy the primitiveType member variable.
 - Fixed a typo in GetApplicationFolderName on linux.
 - Fixed FUDaeTextureFilterFunction::ToString() to write out the LINEAR type
   (missing case in switch)
 - Changed FAXMaterialImport.cpp to also look for OpenCollada technique profile for effects. This adds
   support for bumped mapped materials exported with the OpenCollada exporters.
