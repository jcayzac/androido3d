 Description:
  This library is used to decompress DXTn compressed textures.

 Local modifications:
 - Renamed txc_fetch_dxtn.c to txc_fetch_dxtn.cc so its header can
   include C++ headers.
 - Changed txc_dxtn.h to #include base/cross/config.h rather than
   GL/gl.h. Manually defined GL typedefs using basictypes.h's types.
